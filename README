Our project is based on python, then no makefile needed.

you can just simply type the following command in the terminal

>> python proj1.py -k "your auth key" -p 0.9 -q "your query"

and all the parameters have their default value, you can just simply run 

>> python pro1.py

for the auth key, it is provided inside the python program, but you can change it with the parameter -k
the auth key is :
